## How To Build Quality In (Everywhere)

### Introduction

I was recently asked what I see my role is in the Quality Assurance field.  I often see other QAs (Test Analysts, Test Engineers, Quality Analysts, Quality Engineers, etc.) in the industry restricting themselves to only caring about the quality of individual user stories, and in the rare case this may extend to caring about the overall software that is being delivered.  This is of course could be due to a number of limitations such as inexperience, bandwidth or even from a lack of interest.  

I feel that as a QA, there is so much more to offer, and that you can be an advocate of quality for not only user stories and software, but also the hardware, people and processes that are required to deliver the final product.  I feel that we can contribute on a larger scale than just within the team, whether it be internal or external to the organisation that you are employed at.  In this post, I will attempt to briefly describe the things I am passionate in driving.

### Your Team

Your team is the first place where you can be an advocate for all things related to quality.  This is where everything that you do will ultimately contribute to the delivery of a higher quality product.  In order to achieve this, we must look at User Stories, Processes, People as well as Software and Hardware.

#### User Stories

* **Define Quality**.  One of the first things that I was ever taught to do was to be able to facilitate a discussion on the definition of quality.  This can apply to an user story, a feature or even for the whole project.  The defintion of quality that I learnt is that _quality is some value to some person at some point in time_.  The role of the QA is to ensure that all relevant characteristics (or value) of what makes up quality is discussed and included in the user story.  Common examples that I have always had to deal with, include, Correctness, Performance, Security, Compatibility and Maintainability.  Knowing the scope of these characteristics will often help drive discussions around the correct acceptance criteria to be included in the user story, or even considered at a feature or project level.
* **Automation**.  Compared to a human, a machine is less likely to make mistakes in checking a given set of steps or instructions.  It is often discussed that QA is a combination of checking (automation) and testing (exploration).  With this in mind, it is often best to automate the highly repetitive tasks.  As a QA, you want to ensure the right amount of tests are written at the right level.  You want to also ensuring both the most riskiest items from a business and tehnical point of view are automated.  As per the previous point, it is not only the Correctness characteristic that can be automated.  It is very possible to automate the likes of Security, Performance and Compatibility testing.
* **Exploration**.  With a well-rounded knowledge of the customer and the technology that has been delivered, a QA has the ability to perform manual exploratory testing.  With the boring, repetitive testing now automated, a QA can spend their time performing the more valuable exploratory testing.  Exploratory testing is often known as simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution for a piece of software.

#### Processes

* **Fast Feedback**.  In every project that I am part of, I always strive to ensure that everything we do has short feedback cycles.  This includes our automated tests always running in CI, frequent shoulder checks, frequent kick offs, frequent sign offs, frequent showcases, but most importantly small user stories.  I also often try to remove the reliance on stand ups, showcases and retrospectives to give feedback.  The faster our feedback, the faster we can react to something that has gone wrong.
* **Collaboration**.  Unfortunately, I often find it the role of a QA to gather all stakeholders at a lot of the shoulder checks, kick offs, sign offs or showcases.  However, each of these steps in a story lifecycle is vitally important to ensure that we all have a shared understanding of what we are building.
* **Valuable?**.  Questioning the value of project activities or decisions.  I often find myself in the position of trying to minimise as much waste as possile so that time can be spent on building more features or performing exploratory testing.

#### People

* **Learning**.
* **Sharing**.
* **Innovating**.

#### Software and Hardware

* **DevOps**.

### Your Organisation

Next, your organisation is a place where you can learn and share what other areas are doing in the Quality Assurance field.

* **Awareness**
* **Learning**
* **Sharing**
* **Innovating**

### Your Community

Next, your community is a place where you can learn and share what other organisations are doing in the Quality Assurance field.  It is a place where you can see learn from a diversity of industries and backgrounds, but it also gives you the opportunity to give back to the community and the next generation of professionals in the field of Quality Assurance.
