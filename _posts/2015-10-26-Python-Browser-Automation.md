## Selenium, Page Objects and BDD in Python

### Introduction

In this post, we will have a look at using [Selenium WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) within a Python context.  This is my first usage of Python, and I thought it would be useful to share how we can use Selenium WebDriver for those that a new to Web Browser Automation.  We will make use of the [Page Objects](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/page-objects.html) design pattern which allows for reusability and also reduction in duplicatted code.  We will then make us of [Lettuce](http://lettuce.it/), which is a BDD tool based on Cucumber which will allow us to describe our features and scenarios in a natural language with steps that ultimately call our Python functions.
